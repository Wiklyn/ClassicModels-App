# ClassicModels App

Study project in C#.NET, focusing on learning Entity Framework Core and
PostgreSQL, using the ClassicModels database as a reference. The project covers
entity modeling, relationship configuration, and query execution. Queries are
initially written in SQL to ensure correctness and understanding, and then
transcribed into LINQ to solve SQL-based exercises.

The project is being developed in .NET 8 using Visual Studio 2022 Community
Edition.

ClassicModels is a fictitious company. It's a retailer of scale models of
classic cars. It contains typical business data, including information about
customers, products, sales orders, sales order line items, and more.

The [exercises](https://www.richardtwatson.com/open/Reader/ClassicModels.html)
are found in an instructorâ€™s manual the accompanies the book
[Data Management: Databases and Analytics (open edition)](https://www.richardtwatson.com/open/Reader/_book/data-management-databases-and-analytics.html),
by [Richard T. Watson](https://www.richardtwatson.com). You can read more about
it [here](https://www.richardtwatson.com/open/Reader/_book/preface.html#supplements).

The ClassicModels App is a .NET Console App that allows the user to choose an
exercise (or all exercises) out of a category and see the results of the queries
that answer the proposed exercises.
